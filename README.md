# Project Description

In this project CSS, HTML, and Javascript were all used in order to create a word guessing game. The functionality of the game itself is from the Javascript. The game looks for user key presses to determine whether or not the letter is part of the current word. If too many wrong guesses are typed in the user will lose, and if they guess correctly a new word will appear for them to continue playing.
